Great! Our analysis confirms that our improved extraction function is correctly identifying 19 out of 50 examples, matching the 0.3800 accuracy reported in the evaluation log. This is a significant improvement from our initial results.

Let's summarize what we've learned and accomplished:

1. **Initial Issue**: The model was generating correct answers, but the evaluation script wasn't extracting them properly, resulting in 0.0000 accuracy.

2. **First Improvement**: We updated the answer extraction function to better handle the format of answers generated by the Qwen2.5-7B-DPO-VP model, which improved accuracy to 0.2800 (14/50).

3. **Further Enhancement**: We refined the extraction function with more sophisticated patterns, including:
   - Looking for "Therefore" or "Thus" statements with numbers
   - Improved equation pattern matching
   - Better handling of dollar amounts
   - Searching through sentences in reverse order for numbers

4. **Final Result**: Our improved extraction function achieved an accuracy of 0.3800 (19/50), which is a substantial improvement.

5. **Examples of Success**: The model correctly answered questions about:
   - Calculating total bolts of fiber (Example 1)
   - Download time calculations (Example 7)
   - Cumulative download counts (Example 10)
   - Cost calculations for pastries (Example 11)
   - Salary calculations (Example 17)

6. **Remaining Challenges**: Some examples still have extraction issues:
   - Example 0: Extracted 9 instead of 18 (possibly extracting an intermediate calculation)
   - Example 2: Extracted 130000 instead of 70000 (likely capturing the cost rather than the profit)
   - Example 3: Extracted 3 instead of 540 (capturing a value from the question rather than the answer)

These results demonstrate that the Qwen2.5-7B-DPO-VP model is capable of solving GSM8K math problems with reasonable accuracy (38% on our sample), but proper answer extraction is crucial for evaluation. The model's reasoning is often correct, but it doesn't format answers in the standard GSM8K format with "####", requiring more sophisticated extraction techniques.
