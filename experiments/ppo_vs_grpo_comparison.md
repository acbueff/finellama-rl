# PPO vs GRPO Training Comparison

This document compares the two reinforcement learning approaches implemented for fine-tuning the Qwen2.5 model on the GSM8K mathematical reasoning dataset.

## Overview of Methods

### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

PPO is a policy gradient method for reinforcement learning that uses a clipped objective function to prevent too large policy updates. Key characteristics:

- **Algorithm Type**: On-policy reinforcement learning
- **Update Mechanism**: Updates the policy by comparing the new policy to the old policy and limiting the change
- **Objective Function**: Uses a clipped surrogate objective to constrain policy updates
- **Training Process**: 
  - Generate responses from the current policy
  - Compute rewards for the generated responses
  - Update the policy to maximize rewards while staying close to the previous policy

### Gradient-based Reinforcement with Paired Optimization (GRPO)

GRPO is a paired approach for preference optimization that generates pairs of outputs and computes preference relations between them. Key characteristics:

- **Algorithm Type**: Preference-based reinforcement learning
- **Update Mechanism**: Uses paired samples and preference relations to guide policy updates
- **Objective Function**: Optimizes the policy to maximize the likelihood of preferred responses over less preferred ones
- **Training Process**:
  - Generate pairs of responses for each prompt
  - Determine preference relations between responses
  - Update the policy to increase the probability of generating preferred responses

## Implementation Status

| Feature | PPO | GRPO |
|---------|-----|------|
| Implementation Status | Complete and working | Fixed and ready to run |
| Code Base | `qwen_gsm8k_ppo_train.py` | `qwen_gsm8k_grpo_train.py` |
| Training Script | `run_qwen_gsm8k_ppo.sh` | `run_qwen_gsm8k_grpo.sh` |
| Training Completed | Yes | Not yet |
| Results Available | Yes | Pending new run |

## Current Status

### PPO Results

- **Final Accuracy**: 64.0% on GSM8K validation set (32/50 examples)
- **Training Duration**: ~36 hours
- **Convergence**: Stable training with gradual improvement in reward
- **Benefits Observed**:
  - Improved step-by-step reasoning
  - More consistent mathematical operations
  - Better answer extraction

### GRPO Status

- **Initial Status**: Failed due to configuration and path issues
- **Current Status**: Fixed and ready to run
- **Improvements Made**:
  - Corrected model to use Qwen2.5 3B instead of 7B
  - Standardized paths for consistency with PPO training
  - Added robust error handling
  - Applied memory optimizations from successful PPO training

## Technical Comparison

| Aspect | PPO | GRPO |
|--------|-----|------|
| Sample Generation | Single responses per prompt | Paired responses per prompt |
| Reward Mechanism | Explicit reward function based on correctness | Preference relations between response pairs |
| Training Complexity | Medium (single sample evaluation) | High (paired sample evaluation) |
| Memory Requirements | Lower | Higher (maintains pairs of responses) |
| KL Divergence | Uses KL penalty from reference model | Uses KL penalty between response pairs |
| Model Size | Qwen2.5 3B | Qwen2.5 3B (fixed to match PPO) |

## Applied Optimizations

Based on the successful PPO training, these optimizations have been applied to the GRPO implementation:

1. **Model Configuration**:
   - Using 4-bit quantization
   - LoRA fine-tuning with r=8, alpha=16
   - Flash Attention 2 for memory efficiency
   - Disabled KV-cache during training

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Smaller batch sizes (4 instead of 8)
   - Increased gradient accumulation (16 steps)
   - Mixed precision (bf16)
   - Reduced model parameters via LoRA

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Explicit path checking
   - Robust model loading with clear error messages
   - Fallback mechanisms for non-critical components

## Next Steps

1. **Run GRPO Training**:
   - Submit the fixed GRPO job
   - Monitor progress closely

2. **Complete Comparison**:
   - After successful GRPO training, compare performance metrics
   - Analyze trade-offs between approaches

3. **Future Improvements**:
   - Hybrid approach combining benefits of both methods
   - Exploration of different preference models
   - Ablation studies on hyperparameters
