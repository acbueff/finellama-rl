Okay, let's break down the error output and summarize our progress.

**Analysis of the Error Output (Job 13348446):**

1.  **Initial Error:** The traceback starts within the TRL library (`/tmp/trl-source/trl/trainer/grpo_trainer.py`).
2.  **Root Cause:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'trl.models'`. This means that while trying to import `GRPOTrainer`, the code within `grpo_trainer.py` attempts a relative import like `from ..models import ...`, which fails because it cannot find the `trl.models` submodule.
3.  **Implication:** Even though the `trl` package is found at `/tmp/trl-source` (because we copied it there at runtime), the Python environment inside the container isn't recognizing the *internal structure* of the TRL package correctly when it's located in `/tmp` via an editable install. This is likely due to complexities with how Python resolves packages installed in editable mode, especially when combined with Apptainer's `/tmp` bind-mounting behavior.

**Summary of What Has Gone Wrong:**

The current approach of using an "editable" TRL installation within the container (pointing to `/tmp/trl-source`) and then copying the source code to `/tmp` on the compute node at runtime is causing Python import issues *within* the TRL library itself. Python can find the top-level `trl` package but fails to resolve its internal submodules like `trl.models`.

**Summary of Progress So Far:**

1.  **Container Built:** We successfully created an `env.sif` Apptainer container based on PyTorch 2.1.2 + CUDA 12.1.
2.  **Dependencies Installed:** The container includes necessary system tools (`git`, `cmake`, `ninja`) and Python libraries (`torch`, `transformers`, `datasets`, `accelerate`, `peft`, `flash-attn`, `safetensors`, etc.) with specific versions pinned.
3.  **TRL Installation:**
    *   We initially tried installing TRL from PyPI, but the required `GRPOTrainer` was missing.
    *   We modified the container build to install TRL from the official GitHub source using an "editable" install (`pip install -e .`) pointing to `/tmp/trl-source`.
    *   `pip list` inside the container confirmed `trl 0.17.0.dev0 @ /tmp/trl-source`.
4.  **SLURM Script:**
    *   We created/refined a SLURM script (`chatgpt2_run_trl_grpo_gsm8k.sh`) to run the training.
    *   It sets up the HPC environment (caches, paths, tokens).
    *   It copies the local TRL source code (`grpo-libs/trl-main`) to the compute node's `/tmp/trl-source` directory at the start of the job to make the editable install path valid.
    *   It includes a pre-flight check to verify basic TRL importability.
    *   It executes the training script (`trl_grpo_gsm8k_train.py`) inside the container using `apptainer exec`.
5.  **Troubleshooting:** We resolved several issues along the way:
    *   SLURM submission errors (incorrect parameters, unbound variables like `PYTHONPATH`).
    *   Initial `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'trl'` before implementing the runtime copy.

**Conclusion:** The editable install combined with the `/tmp` bind-mount is proving unreliable for resolving internal package imports.
