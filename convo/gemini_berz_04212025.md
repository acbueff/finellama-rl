Okay, here's a summary of our conversation, focusing on the problems encountered, steps taken, files modified, and commands issued:

**Overall Goal:** Successfully run the `trl_grpo_gsm8k_train.py` script using the `GRPOTrainer` from the TRL library within an Apptainer container on the Berzelius HPC to fine-tune a Qwen model on the GSM8K dataset.

**Phase 1: Initial Setup & TRL Import Issues**

1.  **Problem:** The Python script failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'trl.models'` when run via the Slurm script `container_build/chatgpt2_run_trl_grpo_gsm8k.sh`.
2.  **Diagnosis:** We determined the issue stemmed from how TRL was installed in the container (`container_build/env.def`). It was installed in *editable* mode (`pip install -e .`) using source code cloned during the build. The Slurm script then tried to copy a *local* version of the TRL source to `/tmp/trl-source` inside the container at runtime, which didn't align correctly with the editable install's expectations.
3.  **Solution:**
    *   Modified `container_build/env.def` to perform a *standard* TRL installation (`pip install .`) from the source code cloned *during the container build*. This embeds TRL directly and correctly into the image.
    *   Modified `container_build/chatgpt2_run_trl_grpo_gsm8k.sh` to remove the sections responsible for copying the local TRL source to `/tmp` and the associated pre-flight checks.
4.  **File Modifications:**
    *   `container_build/env.def`: Changed `pip install -e .` to `pip install .` for TRL.
    *   `container_build/chatgpt2_run_trl_grpo_gsm8k.sh`: Removed sections 3 and 4 related to copying TRL source.
5.  **Key Commands:** Initial (failed) `sbatch` commands for the training script. `edit_file` to modify `env.def` and the Slurm script.

**Phase 2: Container Rebuild & Build Failures**

1.  **Action:** Attempted to rebuild the container (`/proj/berzelius-aiics-real/users/x_anbue/env.sif`) using the updated `env.def`.
2.  **Problem:** The container build process failed.
3.  **Diagnosis:** The build failed due to insufficient space in the default temporary directories (`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`) used by Apptainer during the build process on the build node.
4.  **Solution:** Instructed the user to set the `APPTAINER_TMPDIR` and `APPTAINER_CACHEDIR` environment variables to point to a directory on the project storage (`/proj/berzelius-aiics-real/users/x_anbue/...`) which has sufficient space, before running the build command. This was likely incorporated into the `build_container.sh` script or run manually before `sbatch`.
5.  **File Modifications:** Potentially `container_build/build_container.sh` (if env vars were added there).
6.  **Key Commands:** `sbatch container_build/build_container.sh` (multiple attempts until success after setting temp dirs).

**Phase 3: Job Failures with Silent Crashes**

1.  **Action:** Submitted the training job (`sbatch container_build/chatgpt2_run_trl_grpo_gsm8k.sh`, Job ID `13350505`) using the newly built container with the standard TRL install.
2.  **Problem:** The job started but terminated very quickly without any explicit errors in the `.out` or `.err` log files. The logs stopped just after the "Starting GRPO training" message.
3.  **Investigation:** Reviewed log files `logs/trl_grpo_gsm8k_13350505.out` and `logs/trl_grpo_gsm8k_13350505.err`. Confirmed successful setup but abrupt termination.
4.  **Hypothesis:** Potential silent crash due to GPU Out-of-Memory (OOM), library deadlock, or other internal errors not caught by standard Python logging.
5.  **Key Commands:** `sbatch container_build/chatgpt2_run_trl_grpo_gsm8k.sh`, `read_file` (for logs).

**Phase 4: Attempting Memory Reduction**

1.  **Action:** To test the OOM hypothesis, we modified the Slurm script `container_build/chatgpt2_run_trl_grpo_gsm8k.sh` to override specific parameters in the temporary GRPO config file it creates.
2.  **Overrides:** Added `batch_size: 1`, `gradient_accumulation_steps: 64`, `num_sample_pairs: 2` to the temp config section in the Slurm script.
3.  **File Modifications:** `container_build/chatgpt2_run_trl_grpo_gsm8k.sh` (added parameter overrides).
4.  **Action:** Resubmitted the training job with these reduced memory settings (Job ID `13350518`).
5.  **Problem:** The job still failed silently in the exact same manner.
6.  **Investigation:** Reviewed log files `logs/trl_grpo_gsm8k_13350518.out` and `logs/trl_grpo_gsm8k_13350518.err`. Confirmed overrides were applied, but the crash persisted.
7.  **Key Commands:** `edit_file`, `sbatch container_build/chatgpt2_run_trl_grpo_gsm8k.sh`, `read_file` (for logs).

**Phase 5: Switching to Stable TRL Version**

1.  **Hypothesis:** The silent crash might be due to instability or bugs in the TRL `main` development branch (`0.17.0.dev0`) currently installed in the container.
2.  **Action:** Identified `v0.8.0` as a recent stable TRL release containing `GRPOTrainer`.
3.  **Solution:** Modified `container_build/env.def` to explicitly checkout the `v0.8.0` tag from the TRL GitHub repository before running `pip install .`.
4.  **File Modifications:** `container_build/env.def` (changed `git checkout main` to `git checkout v0.8.0`).
5.  **Action:** Submitted the container rebuild job using `sbatch container_build/build_container.sh` (Job ID `13351185`).
6.  **Key Commands:** `edit_file`, `sbatch container_build/build_container.sh`.

**Current Status:** We are currently waiting for the container build job (`13351185`) to complete. This new container will have TRL version `0.8.0` installed. Once the build finishes successfully, the next step will be to resubmit the training job (`container_build/chatgpt2_run_trl_grpo_gsm8k.sh`) using this updated container.
