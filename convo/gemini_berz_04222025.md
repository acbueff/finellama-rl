Okay, here's a summary of the progress during this session, the overall project status regarding PPO/baseline results, and the next steps:

**Summary of Current Session (Troubleshooting GRPO):**

1.  **Initial State:** We started the session after having previously modified `container_build/env.def` to use TRL `v0.8.0` and submitted a container rebuild job (`13351185`), hoping this stable version would fix silent crashes encountered earlier.
2.  **Job Failure (13351830):** A training job submitted using the supposedly rebuilt container failed. Log analysis revealed:
    *   The container was unexpectedly still using TRL `0.17.0.dev0`.
    *   A new, explicit error occurred: `ValueError: You are attempting to perform batched generation with padding_side='right'... Make sure to call \`tokenizer.padding_side = 'left'\``.
3.  **Padding Fix:** We modified the training script (`trl_grpo_gsm8k_train.py`) to set `tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token` (if needed) and `tokenizer.padding_side = 'left'`.
4.  **Job Failure (13351858):** Resubmitting the job with the padding fix resulted in the *exact same padding error*. Log analysis confirmed the container *still* had TRL `0.17.0.dev0`. The padding fix wasn't effective because the TRL version was wrong, and the setting likely wasn't propagating correctly internally.
5.  **Container Build Investigation:** We suspected the container rebuild for `v0.8.0` hadn't worked.
    *   Running the build command (`apptainer build ...`) interactively confirmed it failed during the `%test` phase because `GRPOConfig` was not present in TRL `v0.8.0`.
6.  **Correct TRL Version Identified:** A web search confirmed `GRPOTrainer` and `GRPOConfig` were introduced in TRL `v0.14.0`.
7.  **Container Definition Updated:** We modified `container_build/env.def` again, this time to `git checkout v0.14.0`.
8.  **Successful Container Rebuild:** We ran the `apptainer build --fakeroot --force ...` command interactively. This build **succeeded**, installing TRL `v0.14.0` and passing the internal tests, including the `GRPOConfig` import check.

**Overall Project Status & Previous Results:**

*   **Goal:** The main aim is to compare the performance of the Qwen2.5 3B model fine-tuned on the GSM8K dataset using GRPO versus PPO, and also compare against the baseline (non-fine-tuned) model's performance.
*   **PPO & Baseline:** Previous stages of the project (likely in sessions before this one) involved running PPO fine-tuning and evaluating the baseline model. The specific results (e.g., validation accuracy, metrics) from those runs are not detailed in *this* session's history but are assumed to be available elsewhere for the final comparison.
*   **Current Training Progress:** We have now successfully built a container environment (`env.sif`) with a working version of TRL (`v0.14.0`) that includes the necessary GRPO components. The training script (`trl_grpo_gsm8k_train.py`) has been modified to address the tokenizer padding requirement for Qwen2. We are poised to start the GRPO training run.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Submit GRPO Training Job:** Run the Slurm script using the newly built container and the modified Python script:
    ```bash
    sbatch container_build/chatgpt2_run_trl_grpo_gsm8k.sh
    ```
2.  **Monitor Job:** Keep track of the submitted job using `squeue -u $USER`.
3.  **Analyze Results/Logs:**
    *   **If Successful:** The job completes without errors. Check the output logs for training metrics. Proceed to evaluate the saved GRPO model checkpoint on the GSM8K validation set using an appropriate evaluation script (e.g., adapting `run_ppo_gsm8k_eval.sh` or similar). Then, compare the GRPO results with the previous PPO and baseline results.
    *   **If Fails:** The job terminates prematurely again. Carefully examine the new `.out` and `.err` log files in the `logs/` directory to diagnose the cause of the failure. The error might be different now that the TRL version is correct.
