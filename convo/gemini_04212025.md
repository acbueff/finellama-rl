Okay, here's a summary of our debugging process and the prompt for the HPC environment.

**Debugging Summary:**

1.  **Problem:** We encountered `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'trl.models'` when running the GRPO training script (`trl_grpo_gsm8k_train.py`) on the HPC.
2.  **Initial Setup:** The container (`env.sif`) included TRL installed in *editable* mode (`pip install -e .`) pointing to `/tmp/trl-source`. The Slurm script copied the local TRL source code into `/tmp/trl-source` on the compute node before starting the container.
3.  **Local Debugging:**
    *   We built the container locally (`env_local.sif`).
    *   Using `apptainer exec --bind` to mount the local TRL source to `/tmp/trl-source` inside the local container *successfully* allowed TRL imports, including `trl.models` and the `GRPOTrainer`.
    *   Running the training script locally with the bind mount also succeeded past the import stage.
4.  **Diagnosis:** The success with the local bind mount, compared to the failure with the HPC copy-to-tmp method, strongly suggested that the *editable* install (`pip install -e .`) was unreliable when the source code was merely copied into `/tmp` at runtime. Editable installs often rely on specific path setups that might not be preserved by a simple copy.
5.  **Solution:** We modified the container definition file (`container_build/env.def`) to perform a *standard* TRL installation (`pip install .`) directly from the cloned source code *during the container build*. This embeds the correct version of TRL directly into the container image, eliminating the need for runtime copying and the problematic editable install.
6.  **Verification:** We rebuilt the container locally with the standard TRL install and confirmed that TRL could be imported successfully directly within the container *without* needing any bind mounts for the TRL source code.

**Prompt for Cursor on the HPC:**

Here's a prompt you can give to the AI assistant on the HPC to apply the fix:

```text
Okay, we've diagnosed the TRL import issue. The editable TRL install in the container combined with runtime copying of the source code is unreliable. We need to modify the container build process and the Slurm script.

Please perform the following steps:

1.  **Modify Container Definition:**
    *   Edit the file `finellama-rl/container_build/env.def`.
    *   Locate the `%post` section where TRL is installed.
    *   Change the line `pip install -e .` (which performs an editable install) to `pip install .` (to perform a standard installation).

2.  **Rebuild the Container:**
    *   Execute the necessary command (likely involving `apptainer build --fakeroot ...` or potentially submitting the `build_container.sh` script) to rebuild the main container image (`/proj/berzelius-aiics-real/users/x_anbue/env.sif`) using the modified `finellama-rl/container_build/env.def` file. Ensure any existing container is backed up or overwritten safely.

3.  **Modify Slurm Script:**
    *   Edit the primary Slurm script we've been using, `finellama-rl/container_build/chatgpt2_run_trl_grpo_gsm8k.sh`.
    *   Remove Section 3 entirely (the part that copies TRL source from `$TRL_SOURCE_PATH` to `/tmp/trl-source`).
    *   Remove Section 4 entirely (the pre-flight import check that relies on `/tmp/trl-source`).

4.  **(Optional but Recommended) Test Rebuilt Container:**
    *   After the container rebuilds, run a quick test directly inside the *new* container (e.g., using `apptainer exec /proj/berzelius-aiics-real/users/x_anbue/env.sif python -c "import trl; from trl.models import PreTrainedModelWrapper; print('TRL OK')"`) to confirm the internal TRL installation works without needing `/tmp/trl-source`.

5.  **Submit Test Job:**
    *   Submit the modified Slurm script (`chatgpt2_run_trl_grpo_gsm8k.sh`) to the queue for a test run.

Let me know the results of the container rebuild, the optional test, and the Slurm job submission.
```

This prompt clearly outlines the necessary steps based on our findings. Good luck on the HPC!
