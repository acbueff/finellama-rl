# Project Status Summary: FineLlama-RL Research

## Achievements

The project has made significant progress in comparing reinforcement learning approaches for optimizing language models on mathematical reasoning tasks:

1. **Successful PPO Implementation**:
   - Completed Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-3B on GSM8K
   - Achieved 64% accuracy, significantly outperforming the baseline 7B model (38%)
   - Training completed within the expected timeframe (48-72 hours)

2. **GRPO Implementation and Optimization**:
   - Implemented Gradient-based Reinforcement with Paired Optimization (GRPO) 
   - Identified and resolved critical bottlenecks in the response generation phase
   - Created extensive fallback mechanisms for generation failures:
     - Temperature variation (0.4-0.8) for diverse outputs
     - Caching of successful generations for reuse
     - Greedy decoding fallbacks
     - Template-based fallbacks as last resort

3. **Enhanced Training Robustness**:
   - Improved error handling with exponential backoff for consecutive failures
   - Implemented detailed progress tracking and checkpoint saving
   - Added comprehensive logging for better debugging and analysis
   - Optimized resource usage on HPC environment (Berzelius cluster)

## Current Status

1. **PPO vs GRPO Comparison**:
   - PPO training has been successful with Qwen2.5-3B (64% accuracy)
   - Original GRPO implementation encountered stability issues (job timeout without progress)
   - New optimized GRPO implementation has been completed and is ready for testing

2. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Reduced GRPO sample pairs from 8 to 4
   - Decreased paired batch size from 4 to 2
   - Implemented multi-stage fallback strategy for generation failures
   - Enhanced monitoring and error recovery
   - Created a new training script with improved configurations

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Submit the optimized GRPO training job
   - Evaluate GRPO performance against PPO
   - Document comparative results in the experiments directory
   - Complete the analysis of both approaches for mathematical reasoning

The project has demonstrated that PPO is an effective method for improving mathematical reasoning in smaller language models. The optimized GRPO implementation aims to provide a fair comparison to determine which reinforcement learning approach yields better results for this specific task.

Let me list the libraries used for both PPO and GRPO implementations in our project:

## GRPO Implementation:

**Primary Libraries:**
- **TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning)**: Using the official `GRPOTrainer` and `GRPOConfig` from Hugging Face's TRL library
- **Transformers**: For model loading, tokenization, and utilities (`AutoModelForCausalLM`, `AutoTokenizer`)
- **PEFT**: For parameter-efficient fine-tuning with LoRA
- **PyTorch**: Core deep learning framework
- **Accelerate**: For distributed training and hardware optimization
- **Datasets**: For dataset handling

**Custom Implementation:**
- While we have a custom `src/rl/grpo_trainer.py` file, our current implementation in `qwen_gsm8k_grpo_train.py` leverages the standard TRL implementation with custom generation and preference computation functions.

## PPO Implementation:

**Primary Libraries:**
- **Custom Implementation**: We've built our own PPO trainer from scratch in `src/rl/ppo_trainer.py`
- **Transformers**: For model loading, tokenization, and utilities
- **PEFT**: For parameter-efficient fine-tuning with LoRA
- **PyTorch**: Core deep learning framework
- **Accelerate**: For distributed training optimization

**Not Using:**
- We are not using TRL's PPOTrainer implementation for our main PPO training

## Comparison:

1. **GRPO**: Using the official TRL implementation with custom generation and reward functions
   - Relies on TRL's `GRPOTrainer` and `GRPOConfig`
   - Provides optimized implementation of the Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm

2. **PPO**: Using a fully custom implementation built from scratch in our codebase
   - Implemented in `src/rl/ppo_trainer.py` with supporting classes in the src/rl directory
   - Gives us more control over the training process and algorithm details
   - Inherits from our custom `BaseRLTrainer` class

This hybrid approach (custom PPO + TRL for GRPO) lets us have full control over our PPO implementation while leveraging Hugging Face's optimized implementation for the newer GRPO algorithm.
